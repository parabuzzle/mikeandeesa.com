My mom has never flown with me and has been asking to go on a flight ever since I got my PPL ticket. As part of my week long vacation visiting family and friends in Florida, I thought it would be a perfect time to take her up in the Debonair. The problem was that the only day we could do it was a bit gusty and because of that, we were going to see some light to moderate turbulence at the lower altitudes. After ~telling~ warning her about this several times, she still wanted to go. So we loaded up the plane for a little scenic tour of where I grew up.

## The Plan

The plan was to take off out of KBKV and do a fly over and a few circuits around my grandparent's house. Then we would head to the coast and fly along the coast line down to overfly my Mom's house. 

After the aerial tour and some photography, we would head down to Venice airport and get lunch on the water. 

After lunch we would fly back up the coast and back to KBKV.

It did go as planned...

I knew we would need to stay low to go under the KTPA class Bravo shelf, but it looked like we could get above the big bumps without needing to get into the Class Bravo space... I was wrong. Just watch the video to see how it goes...
