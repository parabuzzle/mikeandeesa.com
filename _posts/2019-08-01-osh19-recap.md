What a show! Wow! So many cool airplanes and awesome people. This is my second year visiting the biggest airshow in the world. Last year I drove up and camped out of my car. It took me a few days to figure out where everything was and really understand how AirVenture works. This year, I flew into the show and camped for the full week. Flying in was a totally different experience for sure. I didn't get to fly the actual FISK approach but it was still pretty amazing regardless. There's just something magical about camping next to your own plane out in the north 40 next too thousands of your closest friends. Your wake up call is a formation of T6s taking off or a group of military jets preparing for their airshow later in the day. If you're a pilot and you haven't camped at OshKosh... what are you even doing? Plan you trip for next year! You can thank me later. I'm so looking forward to doing it all again next year!

Here's a few videos I shot of the whole thing:
