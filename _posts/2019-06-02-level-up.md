Today I completed my 15 hours of dual transition training required by my insurance company in the Deb. With it, I also recieved my high performance and complex aircraft endorsements. I also accomplished a biennial flight review as well. I'm all legal and covered to fly the Deb as PIC whenever I want! The weather was bumpy and the cross winds strong for today's training, but we got it done and I feel super accomplished. Now the adventure can truly begin. Stay tuned :)
