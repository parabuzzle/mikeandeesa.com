Whoa boy, more training! That's right, I've decided that maybe now is a good time to start learning how to fly a plane like professional pilot. With all this social distancing and closed social gatherings going on right now, I figured I'm not going to be going many places this summer. Why not scratch the flying itch with some more training? I mean, I've spent an amount of money on aviation that I'm not ready to admit. I might as well take it to the point where, if things get crazy, I can make some money with it. It also helps that I'm already qualified in terms of aeronautical experience, so it's just a matter of learning how to fly the maneuvers and fine tuning my skills to pass the test.
