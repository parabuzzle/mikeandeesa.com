So this weather for the past month has been pretty uncooperative. In the past month I've gotten just under 2 hours in the plane doing my transition training. It's driving me crazy! Every day I'm available, it seems to be 500 overcast with 2sm of visibility and every day that it's "severe clear" I'm not available or my instructor isn't available. I just needed to vent a bit. The adventures are coming... and so are the videos. Bare with me and this terrible midwestern weather right now.
