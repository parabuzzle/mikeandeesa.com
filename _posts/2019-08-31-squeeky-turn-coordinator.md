Oh no! What's that loud squealing sound coming from the panel?

It turns out the turn coordinator starting making a loud squealing noise after I landed from a long cross country flight. So in today's video, we're heading up to Finefield Aviation to have them take a look and swap it out. I have an instrument checkride coming up and I really don't need the thing crapping out in the middle of the ride.

_spoiler_: As all things in maintenance go... the thing stopped making noises promptly at the threat of a mechanic looking at it and as a result, we're not going to change it out because it seems perfectly fine now after the flight up to 3CK... They will be ordering a replacement to have have in their inventory for when the thing actually does decide to retire.
