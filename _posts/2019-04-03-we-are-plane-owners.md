That's right! We closed on N5451U this morning and the registration has been filed with the FAA! That means we officially own a plane! We'll be taking final delivery of the plane in her hanger at KARR on Saturday to officially get the keys and such. My insurance company is requiring that I get 15 hours of dual in the plane so I won't be able to fly her around straight away, but I have lined up the well known Craig Bailey to teach me all about my new Beech aircraft.

I'll be making a video this weekend after we take delivery of the plane with a walk around and such, but for now here are the specs.

**1967 Beechcraft Debonair 35-C33A**

  * Upgraded to a Continental IO-550B via STC in 2015 (150 hours SNEW)
  * GAMI injectors
  * D'Shannon Engine Baffling
  * Garmin GTN750 and GNS430 WAAS installed
  * GTX 345 ADS-B in/out transponder
  * KCS 55A HSI
  * JPI EDM 830 Engine Monitor
  * Autopilot
  * Engine Heater
  * Shoulder Harnesses
  * Extended Baggage Compartment via STC

Anyway, we are excited to have the freedom of our own plane whenever the mood and weather is right to go anywhere we want!
