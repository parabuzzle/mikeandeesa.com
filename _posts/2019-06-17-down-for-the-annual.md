Today I flew the Deb over to Lake in the Hills to drop her off for the FAA mandated annual inspection. I arrived at KARR super early, hoping to make it all happen before work, but alas, this terrible weather had the airport in hard marginal verging on IFR. Just below my personal minimums to fly. The forecast looked to indicate some improvement so I opted to pre-flight and wait. After about a two hour wait, the ceiling came up to 1,500 ft AGL and looked to be that way for the entire route. That gives me my required personal minimum of 1,000 feet AGL with the legal 500 ft below the clouds. So I pulled her out of the hanger and headed for the runway. The flight was uneventful and I arrived at the airport a little after 9:30 in the morning. We went over my squawk list (which is super minor and nit-picky) and I climbed into their 172 for a flight back to KARR to get my car and head to work for the rest of the day. 

Since I had such an intense pre-buy on the plane by the same shop, and my squawk list is so short, I'm anticipating less than the standard two weeks of downtime. I guess we'll see. 

For now, I'm going to study for the written exam for my instrument rating.
