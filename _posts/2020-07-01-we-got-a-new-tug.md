OMG! A new Tug! Not just any tug either... we got a Best Tugs tug!

Why did we get a new tug? Well, we were planning on moving to New Jersey early this year. We moved all of our hangar stuff out to our new hangar at Morristown Airport (KMMU). This included our tug. Since then, a lot of stuff has changed for us and our move has been infinitely delayed. So we don't have a tug here in Aurora. After discussing it with Eesa, it was decided that we should get a new tug. She convinced me to go full in on a Best Tugs tug. I spoke to Paxton Patey on the phone and he convinced me that the A3 was going to be perfect for us. So I ordered it.
