Today we decided it would be a good day to head up to Racine, WI (KRAC) to get some O&H Bakery Kringle. If you've never had O&H Bakery Kringle, you are missing out! It's only the most awesome pastry known to man. They only seem to carry it in stores in the winter time and usually its one or two flavors only. If you head up to Racine, you can get it all year long and in many different flavors. Plus it's a fun trip. 

After checking the weather and some light flight planning, we off to the airport around 10:00a. A preflight, taxi, and take off had us wheels up around 10:45a. We flew direct which kept us pretty low. Even though it wasn't nearly as hot as it was on our previous flight, it still wasn't all that enjoyable. I kept Eesa's mind off of it by assigning her the task of watching for traffic on the 430 and out the window. It was a super busy day in the Chicagoland area so she was pretty busy with the task. I had flight following as well, which seemed to be an endless stream of traffic advisories all the way there. Upon arriving to the airport, and after maneuvering to sequence into a pretty busy pattern, we were in Racine to quest for Kringle. We got a courtesy car from the FBO and punched O&H into the GPS... And then DISASTER!

O&H isn't open on Sundays! Oh no! I forgot today was Sunday! The long weekend confused my simple little brain and I was thinking it was Saturday. What have we done?! We headed back into the FBO and the guy working there informed us there's an outlet at a truck stop about 15 minutes away that's open. Saved! We jumped back into the courtesy car and were off. When we arrived we loaded up on all the flavors that you can't get anywhere else. Stuff like Cherry Cheese and Key Lime. We also decided to lunch at a little place called Route 20 because it was pushing 1:00p at this point and we were both pretty damn hungry. 

After a pretty good BBQ sandwich and some awesome fried pickles we headed back to the airport. I grabbed the weather and planned a less direct flight by flying straight west before turning south towards Aurora so we could get some altitude and cooler air on the way home. Plus... why not?! More flying :P I filed my flight plan and we were off with a 15 knot head wind down the runway. We climbed up to 6,500 where the air cool. It was also above the haze layer so it was nice and smooth and we ended up with 25 knot tail wind when we turned south. We had an uneventful descent and landing at Aurora and taxied the plane back to it's hangar to clean bugs. After cleaning the bugs and getting the tanks topped off we headed home for another evening of laziness while snacking on the spoils of our quest.
