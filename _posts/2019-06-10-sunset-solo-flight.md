This evening the weather looked "severe clear" and I couldn't resist getting some more solo hours in. I hadn't been up at night in the Deb yet and my night currency just expired. What better way to get my currency back on a clear smooth evening/night!? I took off just as the sun was setting in the distance and headed north to KBUU. My original plan was to fly all the way to KOSH for hour building but I didn't want to get home at midnight so I opted for something closer. Plus I've never been to KBUU, so at least it'll be a new airport in the logbook. 

Despite an AIRMET TANGO (forecast turbulence) for the area, the air was smooth and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. I went around the O'Hare airspace and climbed to 7,500 ft. That IO-550 can really yank the plane up to altitude quick. I pulled the power back and leaned it out to 40 degrees lean-of-peak and cruised up enjoying the views out of the windows. I wasn't flying to get there... I was flying to build solo hours. There was no reason to fly fast.

I landed at KBUU and after a few minutes of reprogramming the avionics (and messing with the dimming settings) I was off once again, headed back to KARR. I got flight following on the way back and enjoyed the lights of the city in the distance. If you don't think about the fact that you're flying thousands of feet above ground you can't see with a single engine keeping you there, it's really quite pretty. Night flying is something to be respected.

I arrived to KARR after the tower had closed for the day. It's so strange to fly in airspace that is usually tower controlled without having a tower control it. I did three nice night landings to get my currency back and packed her in for the night. I only have a few more solo hours to go before the insurance will allow me to carry passengers. My hope is to knock them out this week so I can take a trip over the weekend with Eesa before she goes down for annual next week. We'll see if the weather cooperates.
