Today came to an agreement on the terms of the acceptance of the aircraft and I signed it! The acceptance states that the repairs must be complete to close and we must close by April 12th. I'm hoping it happens faster than that, but hey.. at least its going to get done before June right?! Anyway... now we wait.
