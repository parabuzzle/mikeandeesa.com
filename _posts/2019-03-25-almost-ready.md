Today I stopped by the shop to check on the progress of soon-to-be our plane. She is coming along and they are almost done with all the work. That's both airworthy items and some other small items that I asked to be done while it was in the shop. They showed me the spar carry-through doubler and how it will fit when they put it on tomorrow. They also let me ask a bunch of "newbie" questions and answered them all. 

It's looking like we may be able to close on this plane come April 1st if everything goes well in the shop this week. I'm so excited! I will still need to do 15 hours of dual training for insurance purposes, but I'd probably have done that anyway even if my insurance company didn't require it. Either way, it's going to be dual in **my** plane! What's better than that?!
