We've been passively looking at planes for a few months now and we've made offers on a few that didn't pan out. Yesterday a plane found us! A local seller has a beautiful classic plane that perfectly fits our mission and has the right upgrades. 

After talking with the broker, we were able to meet up this afternoon at the airport to go look at her in person. The photos didn't do it justice and, in person, the plane looks amazing! I think we may have found it. We may have found the plane for our adventures. 

More details to come as the process unfolds and if we agree on price.
