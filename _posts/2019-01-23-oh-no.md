Today was the first of a 2 day full pre-buy inspection. As part of this inspection, the mechanic takes all the inspection plates off and really goes over it with a fine-toothed comb. Well, beechcraft aircraft have an airworthiness directive that states that the wing spar carrythrough needs to be inspected for cracks: [AD-95-04-03](http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/AOCADSearch/1B4E8DED6C75A36B86256A09005D18F7?OpenDocument). 

Well guess what, this plane has a crack on the right front spar carrythrough! This is very repairable, however, the kit is backordered until like June and its going to cost $10K+ for the repair! I'm so glad that our pre-buy inspection found this now! Anyway, this doesn't mean the plane is a no-go. It just means that there's some negotiation that needs to happen with the broker and seller now. 

I told the shop to keep the pre-buy going. At this point, I'm still interested in the plane, but it needs a deep discount.
