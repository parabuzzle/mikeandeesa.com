Today was the [Cavalcade of Planes in Bolingbrook](http://www.cavalcadeofplanes.com/) and we went. Eesa wasn't too thrilled about it because these things tend to be hot with minimal shade. Plus I have a hunch that she isn't as plane obsessed as I am. I want to see and ride in all of them! Anyway, the day was a bit overcast and it ended up being a pretty mild day outside. We saw a bunch of really cool T6's and some gyro planes. I also discovered that my DPE for my PPL is a part owner of a T6 and he was there showing it off. 

The highlight of the day, by far, was the ride we took in the old [Ford Tri-motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Trimotor). This plane is from the 1920's and has 3 motors... hence the name. The price per ticket was $72 each. Yes that's right, we paid $144 for a 15 minute ride in a plane that's nearly 100 years old and it was **WORTH EVERY PENNY**! It really gives you a glimpse into what it was like to travel back in those days and just how much commercial aviation has changed since then. To add to it, the plane is a large tail dragger and the way it sits on the ground and taxis around is an experience in itself. When you couple all that with beautiful views and the smell of the old piston planes and that castor oil, it really feels like a step through the time machine to simpler times for sure.

If you have a chance to ride in this classic piece of aviation history, do it! Don't question it. **JUST DO IT!**!
