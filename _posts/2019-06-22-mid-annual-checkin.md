So today I took a trip up to the airport to check in on how the annual was progressing. It's always interesting to see your plane with all of it's covers removed. I have a few minor upgrades going in and we're waiting on parts to arrive so its looking like I won't get her back until next week. Oh well, it'll be worth it.

Current list of items that needed "fixing".

  * Left main strut was seeping and need to be rebuilt
  * Wheel bearing for nose wheel was wrong part and didn't fit properly
  * All three wheels were in need of balancing

That's it so far and most of the work is done at this point according to the shop.

If all goes well, I get her back next week and she'll be good to go for another year.
