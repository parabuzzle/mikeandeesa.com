Well its that time of year again. Time to take the plane in for her annual inspection. I don't have many squawks to have addressed because I generally try to stay on top of things and have them fixed as soon as we find them. However, annual time is a great time to have those airframe upgrades you've been thinking about done while the plane is down and taken apart anyway. So this time around, I'm having a couple things added which you'll find out about when I pick the plane up. I'll post a video of what we got done while it was in for annual. I may even go through my bill to shed further light on exactly how much it costs to maintain a classic retractable gear bird.

For now, come along with me on a quick and relaxing solo flight up to Lake in the Hills (3CK) to drop the plane off.
