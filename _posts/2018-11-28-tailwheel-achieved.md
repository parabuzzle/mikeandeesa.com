Today I enter the ranks of the tail dragger community. After months of weather and equipment related canceled flights, I have finally done it. I got my tailwheel endorsement. I did my tailwheel training at Luminair at Aurora airport (KARR) with Jared Sebesta in a Bellanca Decathlon known as N5068G. Jared used to fly for Gauntlet Warbirds out there and even took Steve from Flightchops up in the Extra a few years ago.

Those two Flightchops videos are actually the reason why I even got the endorsement in the first place! I want to do aerobatic training and Jared seems to be a good resource for it and he's close (enough) to where I live. Before the aerobatic training can begin, I need to be a tailwheel pilot. It turns out, most aerobatic planes are tail draggers and the ones he trains in are no exception.. So here's to the first step to flying airplanes upside down!
