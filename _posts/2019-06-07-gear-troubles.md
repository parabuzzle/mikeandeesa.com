Uhoh! That's right. Today I had some trouble with my landing gear. It all started yesterday evening when I did my first solo in the plane. I noticed that it felt like it took a little bit longer than usual for the gear to come up into the wells. It was slightly longer, but enough for my brain to think "that seemed a little longer than usual". I had an indication of full retraction so I continued my flight. When I arrived at my destination, I extended the gear and there was no issue there. So maybe it was a case of "auto-rough". It was, after all, my first solo in the Deb. 

I took off on my way back home and this time when I retracted the gear, it took longer than the previous retraction. It was noticeable! I timed it at almost 20 seconds too! When I was approaching KARR, I extended the gear and there were no problems. It happened quick and I got the lock indications. I had an uneventful landing and headed to the hangar. When I got it pushed back into the hangar, I inspected the gear closely and everything looked great. I had a suspicion that the gear motor was in a bad way. I decided to take it up to the shop first thing in the morning.

So this morning, I got up super early to fly the plane over to 3CK and to arrive when the shop opened at 7a. When I took off, the gear took 30 seconds to retract this time!!! Oh yea, that's bad for sure. I was glad to be flying to the shop. When I got in the pattern at 3CK I extended the gear and it went right down with no delay and I got a down indication. Now... here's where I made a mistake and it almost cost me my beautiful plane. I should have cranked the handcrank for the gear to the mechanical stop. Craig told me to always do this if your alternator fails because the 12v is barely enough to push the nose wheel to full mechanical lock and if it doesn't make it, you are going to have a nose wheel collapse on landing. The problem is, this was the only scenario he mentioned and I didn't think to do this in my current situation. I mean, the gear seems to working and the alternator is pumping the full 14v.

When I touched down at 3CK, I had the best landing I have made in the Deb to date and it was a beautiful greaser. Like a butterfly with sore feet. I taxied to the shop and the plane was put up on jacks. When he was putting it up on jacks, he mentioned that the gear door hadn't fully closed on the extension. I didn't think much of it at the moment, until he got in the cockpit and cranked it down to the stops on the handcrank which sucked the door into place... a full half turn! WHOA! That's when I realized that the weak motor is no different than not having the alternator. I realized that I was very close to having my own nose wheel collapse this morning. What if my landing wasn't so soft?! What if there was a heavy cross wind and I had to plop it down? What if, what if, what if?! How close was I to turn my plane into a runway plow this morning?! I know I got incredibly lucky today for sure. That's not even up for debate.

It turns out the motor brushes were showing signs of issues with the motor, so I opted to have the motor rebuilt. I have to bring her in for an annual in a little over a week so I was thinking I would just leave it there, but the shop is way too awesome for that! They pulled a gear motor out of their plane and put it in mine as a loaner for the week so I could keep flying and building hours before annual! How awesome is that?!

Anyway, moral of the story here is, if you suspect an issue with the gear, crank it down to the stops. *ANY ISSUE!* Never risk it... next time may not be a lucky day.
