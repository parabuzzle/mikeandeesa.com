I got the final pre-buy report and, I gotta say, it looks pretty good actually! There are a couple airworthiness items that the seller will take care of (including the wingspar issue), and aside from that, only nit-pick low dollar items to repair. Overall, I'm pretty happy. I even got a good photo of the inside of the empennage. For a plane that's 52 years old, the inside of the tail cone looks like the day it rolled off the assembly line! 

So what about the airworthiness items? How is that going to work? Well, we agreed that my shop is the shop that I want the repairs done and I elected to wait to close until the repairs are complete. My shop has informed me that they _may_ be able to get it done in March which would be awesome! So now we just need to write it up into the acceptence and get this on to the next stage. It looks like we'll be flying her by April... we hope. Fingers crossed :)
