Alright so that last VLOG was a bit of disaster... I can't believe I forgot to plug the camera in. Doh! Anyway, this video has actual flying content, I promise :)

In this episode of the VLOG, I'm heading out to do some solo practice of the commercial maneuvers I learned over the weekend. I did a few Chandelles, Steep Turns, Steep Spirals, and a ton of landings. I have a ton of work to do still to fine tune these to the commercial standards, but hey... we all start somewhere right?

_OMG it was a hot day too.. The air didn't cool off until I was like 6,000 feet above the ground._
